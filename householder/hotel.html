The accommodation package on offer
covers the cost of five nights' accommodation
and all meals (including the conference banquet)
from dinner on Sunday, June 16th
to lunch on Friday, June 21st, inclusive. We intend that the cost of this 
package (in pounds sterling) will be
<UL>
<LI type=disc>
&pound;410.00 for a single room;
<LI> 
&pound;260.00  (per person) for a shared room.
</UL>
These figures represent a reduction of the hotel's
actual rates by &pound;200 per person: we are able to offer this
deal thanks to sponsorship from
<A HREF="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/" TARGET=_top> EPSRC</A>.
Please note that these reduced rates will
only apply to applicants whose abstracts are received before the 11th
December 2001 deadline.

People who require further help with covering accommodation costs,
for example, PhD students or other people with limited access to sources
of funding, will be able to apply to the organisers for an additional subsidy
in due course (after abstracts have been accepted by the committee).

share.
