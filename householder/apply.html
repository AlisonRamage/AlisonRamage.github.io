<P>
Here are some pointers:
<P>
1. Aside from general information, the heart of your submission is the
abstract--an abstract of a talk you would be willing to give if you attend. It will be
one of the main items in judging your application, and the abstracts of the
attendees will be circulated at the meeting. It is a good
idea to take the time to produce a crisp, well-written, informative abstract.
<P>
2. No graphics please. If you wish, you may include in the abstract a URL
pointing to graphics and other supporting material. However,&nbsp; the abstract
should be self-contained.
<P>

3. In the <tt>submittedby</tt> and <tt>author</tt> commands put the
name on the same line as the command next to the left brace.
<P>

4. Place any personal macro definitions at the beginning of the abstract.
<P>
5. LaTeX the form with the template document &nbsp;provided above to make
sure it runs properly and produces acceptable output.
<P>
6. Email the form (without the template) to
<A HREF="mailto:house-request@ma.man.ac.uk">house-request@ma.man.ac.uk</A>.
<P>
7. Your application must be received by <B>11 December 2001</B> for full consideration.
