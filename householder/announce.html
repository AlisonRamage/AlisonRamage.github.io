The Householder Symposium on Numerical Linear Algebra will be
held June 17-21, 2002 at 
<A HREF="http://www.peebleshotelhydro.co.uk/" TARGET=_top>
Peebles Hotel Hydro</A>, Scotland,
about 22 miles southwest of Edinburgh.
This meeting is the fifteenth in a series, previously called the
Gatlinburg Symposia.
The name honors Alston S. Householder, one of the pioneers in
numerical linear algebra and organizer of the first four meetings.
The meeting has traditionally been held in an isolated location and is
very informal in style.  Each attendee is given the opportunity to
present a talk, but a talk is not mandatory.  The format of the
meeting includes scheduled presentations during the day and more
informal evening sessions that are organized electronically shortly
before the meeting.  Spirited discussion is encouraged.

<P>
At the meeting, the eleventh 
<A HREF="http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/householder/prize.html" TARGET=_top>
Householder Prize</A>
 will be awarded for the
best thesis in numerical algebra written since 1 January 1999.

<P>
We hope that the meeting will be attended by recent entrants into
numerical linear algebra as well as more experienced researchers.  We
encourage attendance by core numerical linear algebra researchers,
matrix theoreticians, and people in applications such as optimization,
signal processing, control, etc.

<P>
The 
<A HREF="http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/householder/committee.html"
TARGET=_top>
Program Committee</A>
welcomes your contribution.  The meeting
facility holds only 125 people, however, so attendance may need to be
limited.  

<P>
For full consideration, the committee must receive your abstract by
<B>11 December 2001</B>. 
 Information concerning the application process may be
found 
<A HREF="http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/householder/apply.html"

here</A>.  Please use the format provided.
The committee expects to complete the list of attendees and
scheduled presentations in <B> February 2002</B>.
