On July 4, 1993, Alston Scott Householder, past president of SIAM, died of
a massive stroke. He is survived by his wife Heidi, his daughter Jackie,
and his son John. Two weeks before his death he had attended the Householder
Symposium at Lake Arrowhead, California, the twelth in a series research
of gatherings he had first started at Gatlinburg Tennessee in 1959. Alston
was feeble but alert, and he enjoyed the opportunity to see old friends once
again. He will be greatly missed.
<P>
He was born on May 5, 1904 in Rockford Illinois and shortly thereafter moved
to Alabama, where he spent his childhood. He received his BA in 1925 from
Northwestern and his MA from Cornell in 1927, both degrees in philosophy.
Until 1937 he held various teaching positions in mathematics.
<P>
In 1937 Householder received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University
of Chicago. His subject was the calculus of variations, but mathematical
biology was his first love. He joined the Committee for Mathemtical Biology,
a group of enthusiastic youngsters that collected around the charismatic
figure of Nicolas Rashevsky, and for the next eight years devoted himself
to the area.
<P>
Householder left the Committee in 1944 to help with the war effort. In 1946
he joined the Mathematics Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory and became
its director in 1948. It was here that he turned from mathematical biology
to numerical analysis. In 1969 he retired from ORNL and became a professor
of Mathematics at the University of Tennessee, serving for a while as acting
chairman. In 1974 he retired to Malibu California.
<P>
People of my generation think of Alston chiefly as a numerical analyst
specializing in linear algebra. His interests and accomplishments, however,
were much broader. They include his research in mathematical biology and
numerical analysis as well as his professional and educational contributions.
<P>
Although Householder published work in mathematical biology spans only eight
years, he was quite influential. John Hearon, retired from the National
Institutes of Health, summarized his contributions as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  It is almost impossible to recall the difficulties (on a fiscal shoe string
  in a not entirely cordial scientific community) and the magnitude of the
  task faced by the original group of the Committee at the University of Chicago.
  Hypothesis, conjecture and tentative theory flew in all directions and there
  was a period of great ferment. In the midst of this, to every area to which
  he addressed himself Householder brought organization and systemization.
  He was then, and for some years to come, the only one of the group formally
  trained as a mathematician. It showed. He brought to every problem he undertook
  unification, generality of method and, in the end, simplicity. During the
  relatively brief period under discussion he published 33 papers and a monograph
  on topics which included the theory of neural nets, excitation, sensory
  discrimination, gestalt, binocular vision, diffusion reaction equations and
  enzyme kinetics, psychophysics and factor analysis.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Householder published little during his first years at Oak Ridge, and one
might have reasonably concluded that his productive years were over and he
had settled in as an administrator. What was really happening was that he
was retraining himself as a numerical analysts. The first fruit of his efforts
was his book <EM>Principles of Numerical Analysis</EM> which, in the words
of Jim Wilkinson, ``was the first really modern treatment of Numerical
Analysis.''
<P>
Householder is best known for his contributions to numerical linear algebra.
Again Jim Wilkinson:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  In the 1950's our knowledge of this topic was in a rather chaotic state.
  A large number of algorithms had been developed but no systematic study of
  their inter-relationships had been undertaken. It is primarily due to the
  work of Householder that order has emerged from this chaos. In a remarkable
  series of papers he effectively classified the algorithms for solving linear
  equations and computing eigensystems, showing that in many cases essentially
  the same algorithm had been presented in a large variety of superficially
  quite different algorithms. The resulting classification made it possible
  to concentrate on the the most profitable lines of research and in this way
  his work was directly responsible for the development of many of the most
  effective algorithms in use today. Of particular importance is his appreciation
  of the value of elementary hermitian matrices in numerical analysis.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
But Householder was more than just an organizer of other peoples' ideas.
To cite just one example, The ``elementary hermitian matrices'' mentioned
by Wilkinson are now universally known as Householder transformations and
are one of the most widely used tools in matrix computations.
<P>
Householder was also responsible for promoting the use of norms in numerical
linear algebra, where they have played an important role in error analysis.
In addition, with F. L. Bauer and other collaborators, he showed that norms
could be used to derive localization for eigenvalues, an important contribution
to pure linear algebra. The final result of his labors was his highly influential
book <EM>The Theory of Matrices in Numerical Analysis.</EM>
<P>
Just before and after his retirement, Householder worked on the solution
of nonlinear equations in a single unknown. In a short book on the subject
he stressed its historical development, from K&ouml;nig's theorem to
Ruitishauser's qd-algorithm.
<P>
Householder's professional contributions are too numerous to list in their
entirety. He was vice president of the American Mathematical Society, and
president of SIAM and the Association for Computing Machinery. He served
on the editorial boards of Psychometrika, Numerische Mathematik, Linear Algebra
and Its Applications, and was editor in chief of the SIAM Journal on Numerical
Analysis. He made his personal bibliography available in the form of a KWIK
index on numerical algebra (he read French, German, and Russian with ease).
And he organized the influential Gatlinburg conferences, which continue now
under the name of the Householder Symposia.
<P>
While he was at ORNL, Householder was a Ford Professor at the University
of Tennessee, where I took two courses from him. He taught Wednesday afternoons
and Saturday mornings, which ensured that his classes were not overattended.
Alston was not a polished lecturer, but his material, its clarity and
organization, more than made up for it. Saturdays he would have us work problems
from his texts - Alston never believed in armchair mathematics. I came away
from his courses with an appreciation for the power of matrix methods and
a sense of the history of the subject.
<P>
But Householder's greatest bequest is a personal one. Over time, I have collected
a number of recollections and testimonials concerning Alston, and they all
mention his integrity, his ability to work with difficult people, his
evenhandedness. It is said that intellectual disciplines take on the coloration
of their founders. If that is so, the general good will that prevails in
numerical linear algebra is in no small part due to Householder's legacy
of decency.
