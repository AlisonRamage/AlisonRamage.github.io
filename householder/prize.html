Nominations are solicited for the Alston S. Householder Award XI
(2002). The award will be presented to the author of the best
dissertation in numerical algebra submitted by the recipient of a
PhD earned between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2001.

<P>
The term numerical algebra is intended to describe those parts of
mathematical research that have both algebraic aspects and numerical
content or implications. Thus, for example, the term covers linear
algebra that has numerical applications and the algebraic aspects of
ordinary differential, partial differential, integral, and nonlinear
equations.  To qualify, the dissertation must have been submitted to
fulfill requirements for a degree at the level of a United States
Ph.D.  Candidates from countries in which a formal dissertation is not
normally written at that level may submit an equivalent piece of work.

<P>
The Householder Award, given every three years, was established at the
1969 Gatlinburg Symposium (now renamed the Householder Symposium) to
recognize the outstanding contributions of Alston S. Householder,
1904--1993, to numerical analysis and linear algebra.

<P>
Entries will be assessed by an international committee consisting of
James Demmel (University of California, Berkeley), Ludwig Elsner
(University of Bielefeld), Volker Mehrmann (TU Berlin), Charles Van Loan
(Cornell University) and Olof Widlund (Courant Institute, New York
University).

<P>
The candidate's sponsor (the supervisor of the candidate's research)
should submit five copies of the dissertation (or qualifying work),
together with an appraisal by the sponsor and at least one additional
letter of recommendation supporting the nomination, by
