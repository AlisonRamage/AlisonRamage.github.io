<p>Peebles is fairly difficult to reach by public transport. Unless you are driving to the
hotel, you should aim for Edinburgh first. Details of how to get to Edinburgh are given
below. </p>

<p><b>Update:</b> On June 16th we will provide a number of coaches to take delegates from
Edinburgh airport to the hotel. Some of these will also pick up from Edinburgh city
centre. A timetable is given below. There will be no charge for this service. 
<b>From approximately 10.30am until 7.30pm, there will be a Householder 
representative
waiting near the Meeting Point on the ground floor of the airport
by UK Arrivals and UK Baggage Reclaim. He or she will let you know
where to find the Householder coach for Peebles.</b></p>

<p>Coaches will pick up delegates from the north side of St Andrew Square in the city
centre (look at <a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/map-tt/citythree.html">this map</a> to
find it). </p>

<p>We will also arrange for coaches to return delegates to Edinburgh (city/airport) once
the conference has finished (3.05pm on Friday). More details will be provided once you are
at Peebles. Should you be planning to leave the conference before this time, you will need
to arrange your own transportation, although we will be happy to coordinate ride-sharing
for early leavers when everyone has arrived in Peebles and confirmed flight times etc.</p>

<p>If you want to get a taxi directly from the airport or Edinburgh city centre, you are
advised to contact the Hydro directly or negotiate with a local taxi firm. For example,
Campbell's private hire of Peebles (tel./fax +44 1721 720664, email <a
href="mailto:ian.campbell2@which.net">ian.campbell2@which.net</a>) quotes £30 for a taxi
for 1 to 4 people from the Edinburgh airport. Other local taxi firms are Standard Taxis
(tel. +44 1721 721098) and Tweed Taxis (tel. +44 1721 722222).</p>

<p>There is a regular bus service (no. 62) from Edinburgh to Peebles. On a Sunday, buses
depart hourly from Waterloo Place (just next to the train station, click <a
href="http://www.edinburgh.org/map-tt/citythree.html">here</a> for a map) from 10.20am
until 10.20pm, and the bus takes about an hour to get to Peebles. A single fare is around
£4. The return weekday sevice is half hourly until 3pm then hourly until 10pm. If you
alight at Peebles post office the hotel will be about 500m away (check <a
href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?grid2map?x=325500&amp;y=640500&amp;zoom=3&amp;isp=200&amp;ism=1000&amp;arrow=y?84,124">this
map</a>, the arrow marks the post office) although if you ask, the driver may be able to
drop you off even closer. A full timetable for this service should be available from the
operator, <a href="http://www.firstgroup.com/firstedinburgh/">First Edinburgh</a>. As it
doesn't seem to be available at the moment, an extract of the timetable can be found <a
href="http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/~matrix/EdiPee.gif">here</a>. </p>

<p>The list below may be helpful if you are looking for accommodation in Edinburgh before
or after the conference. Edinburgh is a busy tourist city, so you should act quickly to
reserve a room. The hotels selected are all fairly central and offer reasonable room
rates. The organisers have not seen any of the accommodation so buyer beware! All
telephone (T) and fax (F) numbers on the Edinburgh exchange (dialling code 0131 -- omit
the 0 if outside UK). Prices are per person per night, unless stated. Much more
comprehensive information can be found by contacting the <a
href="http://www.edinburgh.org/">Edinburgh tourist board</a>.</p>
