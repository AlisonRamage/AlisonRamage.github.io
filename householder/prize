Dear Ludwig,

I just submitted this to NA-Digest and ILAS-NET and it will be added
to the conference Web page.
I'll get back to you shortly regarding sending the announcement elsewhere.

HOUSEHOLDER AWARD XI

Nominations are solicited for the Alston S. Householder Award XI
(2002). The award will be presented to the author of the best
dissertation in numerical algebra submitted by the recipient of a
PhD earned between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2001.

The term numerical algebra is intended to describe those parts of
mathematical research that have both algebraic aspects and numerical
content or implications. Thus, for example, the term covers linear
algebra that has numerical applications and the algebraic aspects of
ordinary differential, partial differential, integral, and nonlinear
equations.  To qualify, the dissertation must have been submitted to
fulfill requirements for a degree at the level of a United States
Ph.D.  Candidates from countries in which a formal dissertation is not
normally written at that level may submit an equivalent piece of work.

The Householder Award, given every three years, was established at the
1969 Gatlinburg Symposium (now renamed the Householder Symposium) to
recognize the outstanding contributions of Alston S. Householder,
1904--1993, to numerical analysis and linear algebra.

Entries will be assessed by an international committee consisting of
James Demmel (University of California, Berkeley), Ludwig Elsner
(University of Bielefeld), Volker Mehrmann (TU Berlin), Charles Van Loan
(Cornell University) and Olof Widlund (Courant Institute, New York
University).

The candidate's sponsor (the supervisor of the candidate's research)
should submit five copies of the dissertation (or qualifying work),
together with an appraisal by the sponsor and at least one additional
letter of recommendation supporting the nomination, by February 15, 2002, to

Professor Ludwig Elsner
Fakultaet fuer Mathematik
Universitaet Bielefeld
Postfach 10 01 31
33501 Bielefeld
Germany
email: elsner@Mathematik.Uni-Bielefeld.DE

The award will be presented at the Householder Symposium XV, to be
held June 17-21, 2002 at the Peebles Hotel Hydro, Scotland
(http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/~matrix/).
Candidates on the short list will receive invitations to the meeting.

Previous Householder Award winners were F. Robert (Grenoble) in 1971,
Ole Hald (New York University) in 1974, Daniel D. Warner (University
of California, San Diego) in 1977, E. Marques de S{\'a} (Coimbra) and
Paul Van Dooren (K. U.  Leuven) in 1981 (shared), Ralph Byers (Cornell
University) and James M. Demmel (University of California, Berkeley)
in 1984 (shared), Nicholas J. Higham (University of Manchester) in
1987, Alan Edelman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Maria
Beth Ong (University of Washington) in 1990 (shared), Hong-Guo Xu
(Fudan University) and Barry Smith (New York University) in 1993
(shared), Ming Gu (Yale University) in 1996, and J\"org Liesen (Bielefeld)
in 1999.
