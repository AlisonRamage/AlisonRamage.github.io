The Householder Symposia originated in a series of meetings organized by
Alston Householder, Director of the Mathematics Division of Oak Ridge National
Laboratory and Ford Professor at the University of Tennessee. These international
meetings were devoted to matrix computations and linear algebra and were
held in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. They had a profound influence
on the subject.
<P>
The last "Gatlinburg" conference was held in 1969 on the occasion of Householder's
retirement. At the time, it was decided to continue the meetings but vary
the place. Since then meetings have been held at three year intervals in a variety of venues.
<P>
The meetings, which last for five days, are restricted to about 125 people.
They are intensive, with plenary talks in the day and special sessions in
the evenings. To encourage people to talk about work in progress, no proceedings
are published, although extended abstracts are circulated. The response of
the participants to the meetings has been uniformly enthusiastic.
<P>
The conferences are run in tandem by a permanent 
<A HREF="http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/householder/committee.html"
TARGET=_top> organising committee</A> and
a local arrangements committee. Although attendance is restricted, anyone
- including students - can apply. Selection is made by the organising committee,
generally by ballot.
<P>
The meeting is also the occasion for the award of the 
<A HREF="http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/householder/prize.html"
TARGET=_top> Householder prize</A>
for
the best thesis in numerical linear algebra. This prize is entirely (and
well) supported by contributions solicited at the Symposium banquet.
<P>
